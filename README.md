# Dental_health_model
Category 2 Task 1
Step 1: Data Collection and Preparation
Explanation:
This step involves creating a dataset that includes relevant variables related to dental health, such as brushing frequency, flossing habits, sugar consumption, and indicators of dental health. The data is then cleaned and prepared for analysis, addressing issues like missing values, outliers, and converting categorical variables into numerical formats.

Implementation Strategy:
I created a synthetic dataset using numpy.
Use pandas and scikit-learn libraries in Python to handle data cleaning and preprocessing.

Step 2: Data visualisation using univariate and multivariate analysis
Explanation:
Use histograms to visualize the distribution of numerical variable age.Utilize box plots to identify the spread, central tendency, and potential outliers in numerical variables.Bivariate data visualization involves exploring relationships between pairs of variables. Count plots are useful for visualizing the distribution of categorical variables and understanding how they relate to each other.Data visualization using histograms and count plots allows for a quick and insightful exploration of the dental health dataset. Histograms reveal the distribution of individual variables, while count plots illuminate relationships between categorical variables.

Implementation Strategy:
Use seaborn library to create histogram and countplots.

Step 3: Model Development
Explanation:
In this step, various machine learning models are chosen and developed without hyperparameter tuning. The selected models include Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. The idea is to have a baseline understanding of each model's performance with and without fine-tuning hyperparameters.

Implementation Strategy:
Utilize scikit-learn's implementation of machine learning models for simplicity.
Standardize numerical features using StandardScaler for models like Logistic Regression and SVM.
Train each model on the training data.

Step 4: Model Evaluation
Explanation:
After training the models, their performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. This step provides insights into how well each model is performing on the given data. 

Implementation Strategy:
Use scikit-learn metrics functions like accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, and classification_report for evaluation.
Evaluate each model on the test set to assess its generalization performance.

Step 5: Conclusion and Next Steps
Explanation:
Summarize the findings from the model evaluations, discuss the best-performing models, and identify potential areas for improvement. 

Implementation Strategy:
Interpret the results of each model, focusing on accuracy and other relevant metrics.
